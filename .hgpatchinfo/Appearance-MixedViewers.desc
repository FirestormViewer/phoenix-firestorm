[Appearance/MixedViewers]
- fixed : "Worn items in Viewer 2 and Viewer 1.x aren't synchronized" [see http://jira.secondlife.com/browse/VWR-17594]
    -> current fix compares *only* the wearables in COF with the wearables specified by AgentWearablesUpdate
    -> controlled by "VerifyInitialWearables" (defaults to FALSE with SL-3.0)
- fixed : minor memory leak in LLInitialWearablesFetch::processWearablesMessage()
