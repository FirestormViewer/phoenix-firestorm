// <FS:TS> Define the version and channel substitution macros here instead
//         of via cmake compile-time defines in order to not force a rebuild
//         of the entire newview directory with every Mercurial pull
// NOTE: This file should not be included anywhere in the main viewer code
//         but llversioninfo.cpp. If you need the current viewer version in
//         a different format than is already provided there, then add a
//         function to that file and reference it, rather than building your
//         own function elsewhere.
