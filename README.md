**[Firestorm](https://www.firestormviewer.org) is a free client for 3D virtual worlds such as Second Life and various OpenSim worlds where users can create, connect and chat with others from around the world.**

This repository contains the official source code for the Firestorm viewer.

## Open Source

Firestorm is a third party viewer derived from the official [Second Life](https://github.com/secondlife/viewer) client. The client codebase has been open source since 2007 and is available under the LGPL license.

## Download

> [!NOTE]
> We do not provide support for compiling the viewer or issues resulting from using a self-compiled viewer. However, there is a self-compilers group within Second Life that can be joined to ask questions related to compiling the viewer: [Firestorm Self Compilers](https://tinyurl.com/firestorm-self-compilers)
